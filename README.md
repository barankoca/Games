# Games

- I decided to use MVVM desing pattern. First reason is MVVM can reduce and seperate business logic and view. Provides clean code and easy management.


- If  I had more time I would like to work on image caching and error handlings.


- That api contains too many games. I've always liked games so much.

- Not ready for submit to AppStore. First of all, unit tests should be written.  API has so much endpoints and these can be used to extend the app. Except this needs work on image download and load. Finally, need to notify the end user about connection errors with correct messages.

- I dont want to see blank page when an app is start. Because of that, I loaded games list with paginated results. I think thats the missing thing.
